# Web Template

Example project using current (opinionated) state of the art to try and minimise JS (tooling) burnout:
* Snowpack - modern, fast development, without using node_modules. Develop for the modern web. Uses fastest bundler available: esbuild.
* Svelte - fast and light web framework. Simpler development by feeling closer to vanilla.
* Tailwind - remove the need to organise and maintain masses of CSS and avoid duplicates. Simple, clean way to build modern UI without worrying about limitations of component libraries.
